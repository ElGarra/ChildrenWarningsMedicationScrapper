# ChildrenWarningsMedicationScrapper :chart_with_upwards_trend:

This scrapper allow it users to find warnings of different medications for childrens. We are currently working on the scrapper so it isn't finished. 

1. Setting the scrapper

first of all, you have to install venv library on python, because the scrapper runs on a virtual enviroment:

```pip3 install venv```

After that, you must enable the virtual enviroment:

```source scrappingenv/bin/activate```

In order to install all the dependencies, you have to run the following command:

```pip3 freeze```

After that, you have to copy the output and paste it on the ```requirements.txt``` file. Finally, execute this command:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Now you are ready to run the scrapper!

2. Running the scraper

Just run the script with ```python3 scrapper.py```

If you want to deactivate the virtual enviroment, just execute ```deactivate```

Enjoy it :rocket:
